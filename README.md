# dotNETSpy

This repository contains a fork of [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy),
edited to be compatible with the Windows Store via Project Centennial.
Hence, it will run on Windows 10 S (which only runs apps distributed
through the Windows Store).

As with the upstream ILSpy, dotNETSpy is licensed under the MIT License.
